# ðŸ’» Development Set up

To set up environment for local development, you will need to set up PyEnv and Pipenv:
- [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python versioning.
- [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for dependency management.

Then clone this repo and run `make setup`. This will set up all dependencies and precommit hooks.

Precommit Tools:
* [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) for testing
* [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for type checking
* [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting
* [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for sorting imports
* [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
