OpenSynth Model Repository.


# üíª Development Set up

To set up environment for local development, you will need to set up PyEnv and Pipenv:
- [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python versioning.
- [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for dependency management.

Then clone this repo and run `make setup`. This will set up all dependencies and precommit hooks.

Precommit Tools:
* [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) for testing
* [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for type checking
* [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting
* [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for sorting imports
* [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting


# Available CLI apps:
- `pipenv run python app/app.py` for a list of Typer app commands
- `get-lcl-data`: Downloads, Split, Preprocesses LCL dataset.


# üíΩ Downloading Low Carbon London dataset [[1]](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households)
- The compressed version of the data from data.london.gov.uk is ~ 700Mb. The full decompressed data is about 8Gb.
- Note: LCL data was compressed with compression algorithm that doesn't work with Python's `zipfile`. You'll need to manually unzip it via command line with `unzip` on Linux systems, or other equivalent on Windows machine.
- You can also download the low carbon london dataset using the typer app command `pipenv run python app/app.py --download`. This will use the subprocess module to unzip the file (for linux machines).
- If you're on windows, you'll need to manually download and unzip to the folder: `data/raw`

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Low Carbon London Dataset
- Low Carbon London dataset was from a trial conducted by UK Power Networks on a representative sample of London households from 2011 to 2014.
- The dataset contains half-hourly smart meter readings of 5,567 households.
- All timestamps are given in UTC so there's no time-zone conversation needed (i.e. 48 half-hourly data a day per household)
